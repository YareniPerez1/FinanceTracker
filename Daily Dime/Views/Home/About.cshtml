                What began as a capstone project has evolved into something meaningful. We're a group of developers, designers, and dreamers who believe managing money shouldn’t be overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                From tracking income and expenses to setting financial goals, our mission is to make these tools easy, intuitive, and even enjoyable.

                We’re more than just code and charts. Our team thrives on collaboration, creativity, and the occasional (okay, frequent) coffee-fueled brainstorm.
            </p>
            <p>
                From late-night debugging to team lunches filled with laughter, Daily Dime has been built with joy and teamwork every step of the way.
